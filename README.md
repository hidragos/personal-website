## Personal Website ðŸŒŸ

This is my personal website, where I showcase my talk about myself, my experiences, projects, and skills. It's a work in progress, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it. If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out!

### Features ðŸš€

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Dark Mode & Theming**: Easily toggle between light and dark mode and two beautiful themes.
- **Internationalization**: The website is available in English and Spanish. (RomÃ¢nÄƒ Ã®n curÃ¢nd!)
- **PDF Resume**: Single source of truth for my resume. Download a PDF version of my resume with the click of a button. (Coming soon!)
