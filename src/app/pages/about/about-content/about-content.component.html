    <mat-card-title>ðŸ¤© Let me tell you a little bit about me </mat-card-title>
  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with over 5 years of experience in building
      business applications. Turning ideas into robust digital experiences that
      are both visually appealing and highly functional brings deep satisfaction
      to me and are the reason I love what I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me making music or reading
      something about the nature of reality. I'm also an enthusiast
      photographer, and I very much enjoy being outdoors biking or skating. My
      daily process involves meditating and deep thinking of ways to improve
      myself and the work I do.

  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      With a solid foundation in Angular, .NET, and Azure, I bring a
      comprehensive understanding of the entire application lifecycleâ€”from
      design and development to deployment and monitoring. My experience also
      spans project management, sprint planning, and client communication,
      allowing me to deliver projects that drive real business growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive on solving complex challenges, whether it's optimizing
      performance, crafting intuitive UI/UX, or integrating APIs. My focus is
      always on delivering seamless solutions that exceed client expectations.
      I'm a strong advocate for clean, maintainable code and believe in thinking
      twice before coding. Staying updated with the latest web development
      trends is important to me, as it ensures my work remains at the cutting
      edge.
